## An Eleventy starter

Based on [Better 11ty Development with Tooling](https://www.jetbrains.com/guide/javascript/tutorials/eleventy-tsx/).

The approach with this starter is to distinguish between stateless UI components which have types expressing their contract with Eleventy. The `elevent.ts` file stores the types we expect from Eleventy, these can be updated when adding more collections with different frontmatter etc.
